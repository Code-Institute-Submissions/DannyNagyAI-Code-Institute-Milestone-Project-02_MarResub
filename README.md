# Real Madrid Game Finder

![alt text](https://github.com/DannyNagyAI/Code-Institute-Milestone-Project-02/blob/main/rm_teaser.jpg "Header of the One Page")

>This website was made for a fictive company named **(Real Madrid Game Finder Co)** that needed a website to show all upcoming games for Real Madrid this season. 

The website displays information via a "button click" about upcoming Real Madrid games and also more info such as date, home team, away team, arena and city. It also has some short information about the Real Madrid Game Finder Co. in the footer, for the user to contact or get a clearer picture of the company background.

My idea was to build the one page with a very simple usability and that also to make it easy for all **(Madridistas()aka Real Fans)** to find their team's upcoming games. 

## User Experience (UX)
The idea for this project was to build a API front-end website for a fictive company that is showing Real Madrid's upcoming games. 

Real Madrid Game Finder Co. is interested in getting more people that likes Real Madrid to find upcoming games easier and also through their own website.

The audience for this website are people that are nuts about both Real Madrid and football.

**To be able to help the Real Madrid Game Finder Co with their needs, I had to include:**
- A clean one page with focus on the matches/games. 
- Getting information about the upcoming games through API.  
- A one click button to get infomation about the dates, home team, away team, arena and the location of the sport event. 
- Showcase reults of the API in a userfriendly table.  
- A simple contact information in the footer. 

>I tried to stay on the same path during the entire project with both colors and pictures.

### Issues/problems/improvements
No known bugs or bigger problems, however some minor things should be fixed: 

- The page could share more infromation about the games such as standings, players and social links to Real Madrid etc. 
- A place for banners to make Real Madrid Game Finders find an extra way to get income. 
- The design could improve such as colors, logo and more. 
- Get rid of button and get the matches to be loaded automated.
All this would be in the 2.0 version.
